Insight Data Engineering - Coding Challenge

This is a Python project by Yue Lu for Insight Data Engineering coding challenge. Copyright reserved.

This project calculates the average degree of a vertex in a Twitter hashtag graph for the last 60 seconds, and update this each time a new tweet appears, which will thus be calculating the average degree over a 60-second sliding window.

This solution requires no additional libraries, environments, or dependencies.
